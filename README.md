### **Description / Rationale**
This repository demonstrates web-based implementation of DeOldify, a Deep Learning based project for colorizing and restoring old images. This project demonstrates implementation of 2 models:
1. Original artistic DeOldify model ("original" folder)
2. Quantized DeOldify model ("quantized" folder).
